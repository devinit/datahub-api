    \\"narrative\\": \\"This page allows you to explore three scenarios for future poverty levels both globally and by region up to 2030. The baseline scenario uses current forecasts for growth in consumption and current inequality levels. The best-case scenario shows what happens with more rapid growth that is shared more equally. By contrast, the worst-case scenario sees slower growth and increasing inequality. Forecasting future poverty levels is difficult, given the inherent uncertainties involved. Poverty modelling develops future scenarios to help inform policymaking. These models rely on simplifying assumptions, often focusing on economic growth and income distribution trends which determine how much poor people benefit from that growth.Data accessed from source: 20 August 2013.\\",

This is in line with differences observed between past forecasts and actual outcomes. For inequality, an annual 0.25 percentage point change in the shares of national consumption between the poorest 40% and the richest 10%\\",
